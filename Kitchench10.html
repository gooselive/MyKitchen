<!--l. 2959--><p class="noindent" >John and I have always loved Asian food and have been blessed with a good friend who was raised in
China. Don Lin was the Number 1 son of a wealthy Mandarin family, so he never had to cook at home.
But he loved to spend time in the kitchen watching the family cook. He left home at 15 to escape the
invading Japanese, and then was advised not to return when the Communists took over in
1948. He did not return until China was reopened in the late 70s and during those years in
exile, he recreated the dishes of his childhood. Like my mother-in-law, Don never wastes
anything and he is also expert at using whatever is at hand. A good example is his Peking
Duck.

<!--l. 2980--><p class="noindent" >
        <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-120">Ingredients</span><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">: </span>2 3 lb. chickens <br 
class="newline" />12 scallions <br 
class="newline" />12 flour tortillas <br 
class="newline" />Hoisin Sauce: 1 cup Hoisin Sauce <br 
class="newline" />2 - 4 Tbsp. sugar <br 
class="newline" />1  -  2  Tbsp.  water  (Needs  to  be  of  consistency  to  brush  on  tortillas  with  scallion
        brushes)
<!--l. 2982--><p class="noindent" >Wash the chickens thoroughly under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Hang by string
over sink for at least 6 hrs. to dry. Preheat oven to 375<span 
class="ptmr8c-x-x-109">&deg;</span>. Lightly grease an oven rack and
set in middle of oven. Fill a large shallow pan about 3/4 full and place below rack with
chickens. (This will eliminate a lot of clean-up). Roast chickens 30 min. with breast up.
Reduce heat to 300<span 
class="ptmr8c-x-x-109">&deg; </span>and roast 1 hr. breast down, then another 30 min at 375<span class="ptmr8c-x-x-109">&deg;</span>with breast
up.
<!--l. 2991--><p class="noindent" >While duck/chicken is roasting prepare scallion brushes. Cut 3" from the white bulb end of scallions
and discard the green part (I store it in Tupperware for another use.) Cut off root tip. Wit h a very sharp
knife, cut the scallions half way down from the green end. Repeat three times till scallions are cut in
eighths. Submerge in ice water. The green ends will spread apart like a brush, leaving the white end as a
handle.

<!--l. 2999--><p class="noindent" >When chicken is done and cool enough to handle, dis-joint wings and drums. Next remove all
skin. Cut skin and meat in pieces about 2" x 1". Place meat on serving tray surrounded by
pieces of crisp skin. Pass the tortillas, Hoisin sauce, scallions and duck. Each diner paints
his tortilla with Hoisin sauce, using the scallion. Then he adds a piece of skin and a piece
of duck/chicken. Then the tortilla is rolled up and eaten with the hands. Peking Duck is
the climax of the meal in China so you would have begun the meal with some egg drop
soup, egg rolls, etc. In China, you are served many, many dishes prepared from the meat
of the duck as a prelude. When we were in Peking, John passed on most of these, saving
his appetite for the Peking Duck, which is brought to your table for display before being
returned to the kitchen for carving. Imagine his dismay when our waiter returned with the
pancakes, sauce and the skin of the duck but no meat. We definitely prefer Don&#8217;s Americanized
way.
<!--l. 3015--><p class="noindent" >I find it difficult to make Peking Chicken for more than 8 people, but the following recipe
will serve 10 to 12, and has a similar flavor. It not near as much fun but a big hit with our
guests.

class="newline" />2 cups light soy sauce <br 
class="newline" />2 cups dry sherry <br 
class="newline" />4 large cloves garlic, minced<br 
class="newline" />4 tsp. pared ginger root, minced
<!--l. 3029--><p class="noindent" >Rinse chicken; pat dry and place in two 9x13 baking dishes. Combine the above ingredients and pour
over chicken. Refrigerate overnight.

        <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-120">Ingredients</span><span

class="newline" />1 cup Hoisin sauce <br

class="newline" />2 cloves garlic

<!--l. 3038--><p class="noindent" >Preheat oven to 350<span 
class="ptmr8c-x-x-109">&deg;</span>. Remove chicken from marinade and drain. Discard the marinade. (It always hurts
to do this). Place chicken in baking dishes; combine the above ingredients and pour over
chicken. Bake, basting occasionally. Turn chicken once during baking. When chicken is tender,
about 45 min., remove from oven and serve with boiled rice and the sauce from the baking
pan.

        <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-120">Ingredients</span><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">: </span>4 whole boneless chicken breasts <br 
class="newline" />3 Tbsp. soy sauce <br 
class="newline" />2 Tbsp. dry sherry <br 
class="newline" />3 Tbsp vegetable oil * <br 
class="newline" />1 Tbsp. finely chopped ginger root<br 
class="newline" />2 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br 
class="newline" />1/4 lb. mushrooms, sliced <br 
class="newline" />2 green onions, cut diagonally into 1/2" pieces. <br 
class="newline" />1 small head Chinese cabbage cut into 1" pieces. <br 
class="newline" />1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved <br 
class="newline" />1 can sliced bamboo shoots <br 
class="newline" />1 tsp. sesame oil, optional
<!--l. 3064--><p class="noindent" >* Asian cooks prefer peanut oil

<!--l. 3066--><p class="noindent" >Cut chicken into bite-size pieces and combine with soy sauce, sherry and 2 Tbsp. cornstarch. Mix well
and let stand 30 min. Drain and reserve the marinade. Heat 2 Tbsp. of the oil in a wok or large skillet.
Stir-fry the chicken about 3 min. and then remove from wok. Wipe out wok with paper towel
and add l Tbsp. oil. Add the ginger root, garlic, mushrooms, onions and stir-fry for 1 min.
Add the cabbage, tomato and bamboo shoots along with the reserved marinade. Cook 1
min. If using the sesame oil, add at this time and cook another 30 seconds. Serves 4 over
rice.
<!--l. 3076--><p class="noindent" >Note 1. This recipe is one of the basics of Cantonese cooking. You can use any vegetables
that are in season, - broccoli, carrots, snow peas, water chestnuts. Just be sure you put the
vegetables which require a longer cooking time in first. Note 2. Moo Goo Gai Pan is my litmus
test for any new Chinese restaurant. If it tastes like vegetables cooked in chicken broth, go
elsewhere. It should have all sorts of subtle flavoring. Each chef has his own. The above are my
favorites.

class="newline" />2 green peppers <br 
class="newline" />1/4 cup oil
<!--l. 3102--><p class="noindent" >* I learned from Dee Wang&#8217;s cookbook that if you partially freeze the meat for Chinese recipes, you can
easily slice it in the food processor, so I recommend freezing all meats before you prepare a Chinese
recipe.
<!--l. 3107--><p class="noindent" >Slice chicken breasts thinly and marinate in the mixture of soy sauce, chicken broth and cornstarch and
pepper for 20-30 min. Meanwhile combine the ketchup, vinegar, wine, sugar, chilies and Tabasco.

Remove seeds and membrane from washed peppers and cut into pieces 1" sq. Put 1 Tbsp. oil in wok.
Stir-fry peppers over med-high heat for 1 min. Remove and wipe out wok. Add the remaining oil and
when hot, put in the drained chicken and stir fry until it loses its pink color. Add the sauce; bring to a
boil and cook for 1 min. Add green peppers to the chicken; Mix well and serve over rice to
4.

<!--l. 3131--><p class="noindent" >Cut the skinned chicken into bite-sized pieces. Heat the oil in wok or skillet until sizzling. Add chicken,
onion and celery and stir-fry until chicken begins to brown. Add the butter, walnuts and lemon zest.
Cook a few minutes, stirring. Remove from heat and add the lemon juice and soy sauce. Stir until
chicken is well coated and serve over rice to 4.
<!--l. 3138--><p class="noindent" >We like Japanese food equally as well as Chinese and it is a little simpler to prepare. However, always
remember that the Japanese take great pains in the presentation. You&#8217;ll need a colorful garnish to make
up for the relative lack of color on the plate.

pieces.
